Thank you for choosing our game of Crazy 8's! You will be prompted to answer a few questions and then the game will be started.

Best of Luck!

The Object of the Game:
  - In Crazy Eights, every player receives 7 cards in each round (the most common number of cards), and the objective of the game is to discard all of the cards as soon as possible before other players. After each round, each will player receives points based on their hands, and after all the rounds, the player with the least number of points wins.

Rules:
  - To play card a card, the card should match either the number (A, 1, 2, K...) or the suit (Clubs , Diamonds, Hearts , Spades) of the top card in the discard pile
  - Cards with the number 8 are considered wild cards and can be played anytime regardless of the number and the suit
    - The player can change the suit of the top card by playing an 8 card and calling a suit
  - If a player doesn't have a matching card, they will keep drawing a new card 3 times until they receive a playable card
  - If 3 draws are reached and no playable card is in hand, the turn will pass to the next player

After each round, the points will be distributed as follows:
  - 8 Cards: 50 Points
  - Jack, Queen, King: 10 Points
  - 2, ..., 10: Card Value Points
  - Ace: 1 Point

During the game, cards with any words in them will be represented by the first letter of the word:
  - Jack => J | Queen => Q | King => K | Ace => A | Spades => S | Hearts => H | Diamonds => D | Clubs => C

Have fun!
